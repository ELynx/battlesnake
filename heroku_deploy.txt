Gradle build customizes newrelic.yml to have application name equal to Heroku app name
For this it is necessary to enable access to variables and pass them properly to gradle

Enable access to variables for dyno - Labs feature dyno-metadata
https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dyno-metadata
Enable it for application

Then Gradle demon does not receive environment because it is started as separate process
Disable demon on Heroku build pipeline with specifying following environment variable
GRADLE_TASK -Dorg.gradle.daemon=false build -x test
This adds daemon disable on top of usual Gradle buildpack command
